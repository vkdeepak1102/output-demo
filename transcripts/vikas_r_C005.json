      "text": "good morning, vikas. welcome to the interview for the python developer role. how are you today?"

      "speaker": "candidate",

      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "before we begin, i\u0092d like to give you a quick overview of today\u0092s interview. we\u0092ll discuss your python experience, object-oriented programming concepts, and your general coding approach. let\u0092s start with your background. can you tell me about your experience working with python?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "sure. i have around three years of experience using python for scripting and small application development. i have mainly worked on automation scripts and backend utilities."

    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "that\u0092s good. let\u0092s move into object-oriented programming. can you explain what oop is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "oop stands for object oriented programming. it includes concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "can you explain inheritance with a practical example?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "inheritance means one class can take properties from another class. i understand the definition, but i find it a bit difficult to explain real-life examples clearly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "that\u0092s okay. can you explain polymorphism?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "polymorphism means the same function name can behave differently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "how comfortable are you with designing classes for real-world problems?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "i usually follow existing patterns, but i\u0092m not very confident in designing complex class structures from scratch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "let\u0092s talk about exception handling. how do you handle errors in python?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "we use try and except blocks to catch exceptions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "can you give an example of a custom exception you have created?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "i haven\u0092t created custom exceptions yet. i mostly use built-in ones."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "alright. do you have experience writing unit tests for your python code?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "i have limited experience with unit testing."
