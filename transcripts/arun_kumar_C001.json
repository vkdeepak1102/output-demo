      "text": "good morning, arun. welcome to the interview for the backend engineer role. how are you today?"
    },

      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "good morning. i\u0092m doing well, thank you. i appreciate the opportunity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "before we begin, i\u0092d like to give you a brief overview of today\u0092s interview. we\u0092ll be discussing your background, python fundamentals, and some backend-related concepts. let\u0092s start with your background. can you tell me about your experience as a backend engineer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "sure. i have around three years of experience working mainly with python. in my current role, i work on backend apis and basic database operations. i mostly handle feature development and bug fixes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "that sounds good. let\u0092s talk about python fundamentals. can you explain the different data types available in python?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "python has data types like integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "can you explain the difference between a list and a tuple?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "a list is mutable, so we can change it, and a tuple is immutable, so we cannot change it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "good. now let\u0092s move into data structures. can you explain what a stack is and where it is used?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "a stack follows the lifo principle. i understand the concept, but i haven\u0092t really used it much in real applications."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "okay. how would you implement a stack in python?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "i think we can use a list, but i\u0092m not sure about the exact implementation details."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "that\u0092s fine. can you explain the difference between a stack and a queue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "a stack is lifo, and a queue is fifo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "have you worked with more advanced data structures like trees or graphs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "i have studied them theoretically, but i haven\u0092t implemented them in my projects."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "understood. let\u0092s talk briefly about performance. how do you analyze the time complexity of a python program?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "i know about big o notation, but i usually don\u0092t calculate it unless required."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "thank you for your honesty. do you have any experience optimizing code for performance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "not really. i mostly write simple logic that works correctly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "alright. that\u0092s all the questions from my side. do you have any questions for us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "no, i think that\u0092s fine. thank you for your time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "interviewer",
      "text": "thank you, arun. it was nice speaking with you. we\u0092ll get back to you with the next steps."
    },

      "speaker": "candidate",
      "text": "thank you. have a great day."
